Today I read a tweet that say:

_Your first podcast will be bad._
_Your first video will be bad._
_Your first web page will be bad._
_Your first post will be bad._
_Your first day at everything will be horrible._
_But you can't do your #50 without doing your first._

_The beginning is always the hardest part of everything._

_Just do it._

So if you start something new, its hard but you can do it. Stay focus on the path you are taking.
